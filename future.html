        <p class="text-body">I think I want to defintely finish this Bachelor of Computing Science Degree. I'd also like to keep working at my job at Saasyan, learning new web technologies and securities. I think I would like to major in Cybersecurity & Privacy for my degree, it was either between that or AI. The only reason I don't want to do AI is because there is too much maths and it might get boring for me. Cybersecurity is fun and you get to hack stuff, who doesn't want to hack stuff. </p>
        <p class="text-body">Sorry, if I don't write enough for this page. I don't really think that far ahead in terms of my future right now. :)</p>
