        <p class="text-body">Yeah, so this is the super serious page where I talk about the technical, aesthetic, and accessibility aspects of this site and what not. For the theme, I was going for a retro laid-back sort of site. The colours, styling and language used represents that.</p>

        <p class="text-body">Below is the directory structure for my site. Having a good directory structure is good for rapid development, as time spent searching on where resources are, is time spent not developing.  It consists of a public folder - containing all non .css or .html resources, e.g. images and fonts. After the public folder there is the 4 HTML files, each with their own respective content. Then you have websystems.css which contains the CSS for the entire site, this means all the styling across the site uses the same style sheet. This is great for both developmental purposes (everything is changed at once) and also design purposes (consistency).</p>

        Now that the file structure has been layed out. Its time to talk a bit about the page structure itself. Below is a table of all my main CSS classes & ids, and their respective purpose.

                    <td>Styles the sub headings you see around the site, e.g Technical Aspects, Aesthetics.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>#navbar ul </td>
                    <td>id + element</td>
                    <td>First using an ID to specify the element. Then styling the element. This part of the navbar styled is the unordered list containing its li elements.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>#navbar ul li a</td>
                    <td>id + element</td>
                    <td>First using an ID to specify the element. Then styling the element. This part of navbar styled is each list item e.g Home, Past, Future. This styling also has another version of it with :hover added on which controls what styling occurs when the users mouse hovers over the list item.</td>
                </tr>
                
            </table>
        </div>
       
        <p class="text-body">So what was the reasoning behind whether to style an element, a class or an id? Well, quite simply it came down to what the styling was needed for, and if it would be used again. If the styling was a one off for a big feature that would never be used anywhere else in the website, I chose to style the element specifically. If the styling needed to applied in a variety of places - then I made it a class. If it was a one off but could be used again then I made it an ID. (also it was in the specification to use an ID somewhere).</p>
        
        <h4 class="timeline-heading">Key Technical Decisions I made: </h4>
        <p class="text-body">As this is a Web Systems course and not an English course I thought I'd outline some of the other more specific technical choices I made in dot point format, rather than writing out an essay for each one.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choosing to organise my files by using a public folder. - this is good for a scalable website, having the structure in place already means if your site wants to scale up and add more features then you have the structure ready.</li>
            <li>Making the title style a font not an image - leads to faster load times</li>
            <li>Stucture my website in a top-down column like format. This enables the website when viewed on mobile or skinner screens to condense and resize easier. This is expanded on more in <a class="in-text-link" href="#Accessibility">Accessibility</a></li>
            <li>Hosting the webpage using <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/" class="in-text-link">GitHub Pages</a>, this enabled for rapid implementation and hosting of the site. <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/" class="in-text-link">GitHub Pages</a> gives you a free hosting plan per account for static content - perfect for this site. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-body">Finally, the advantage of having such a "raw" site is the peformance of it. Nowadays sites are far too bloated with tons of 3rd party add ons, this adds to the load times. So to test my site I used <a target="_blank" class="in-text-link" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a> a site testing tool, this tests Peformance, Accessibility, Search Engine Optimisation and also PWA testing (but we don't need that). Below are the peformance results.</p>
        <div id="lighthouse_performance_image">
            <img src="public/images/google_lighthouse_performance.png" alt="My Peformance Results">
        </div>
        <p class="text-body">Woah, really good results. Practically perfect. Now for comparrison lets look what the UTS landing page recieves as its score.</p>
        <div id="uts_performance_image">
            <img src="public/images/uts_lighthouse.png" alt="UTS Peformance Results">
        </div>
        
        <p class="text-body">Yeah, so quite clearly a worse result. This is because the UTS page is dealing with more images and more things to download, as well as the addition of extra scripts that need to be loaded and such. One big metric to compare is the <b>Time to Interactive</b> metric. You can see the difference in time is a whopping 10.6 seconds. If you look at the graphic below, 1 in 4 users will abandon the page at 4 seconds, then around 1 in 3 users at over 10 seconds. 1 in 3 users is a huge ammount and page load time should be a critical issue in site development.</p>

        <h3 id="aesthetics" class="sub-heading">Aesthetics</h3>
        <p class="text-body">As stated earlier on this page, the main theme I was aiming for was a retro laid-back style. This allows me to make the site minamalistic, whilst also maintaining a sense of character. </p>
        <p class="text-body">To keep the site from feeling overcrowded as well as avoiding too much contrast (feels bad on the eyes), the colour palette was kept small - to 4 colours to be exact. These colours being:</p>

        <ul id="colours-list">
            <li><span id="main-background">&#9632;</span><b>Main Background</b> - Dark Slate  </li>
            <li><span id="secondary-background">&#9632;</span><b>Secondary Background</b> - Deep Matte Grey</li>
            <li><span id="main-text">&#9632;</span><b>Main Text</b> - Silver Fox </li>
            <li><span id="secondary-text">&#9632;</span><b>Secondary Text</b> - Are ya yellow?!   </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-body">So why these colours? Well other than the fact I have no deisgn skills, I wanted firstly to have a nice dark background, dark slate was a good choice for this. Following this I had an idea of a sort of "container box". This is the box you are reading in now, a good choice for the background of this "box" was the Deep Matte Grey, slightly lighter than the dark slate but still with a nice feel to it. Now onto the text, I played around with a couple colours for a bit, but nothing felt right. Then I went to white, 
            and it looked better than the others but still wasn't to my liking. So I did the thing all web devs do best which is googling stuff - "what colour reads well on grey", the answer I got. Silver. Finally, I had to choose the secondary text colour. I went through a series of trials, red, green, blue, purple, pink, but everything seemed off. I finally arrived at yellow, and thought it fit the retro theme well.</p>


        <h4 class="timeline-heading">Key Aesthetic Decisions I made: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Making the navbar elements change colour as they are hovered. - This provides a sense of reactivity for users. </li>
            <li>Choosing to have a content box (the one you are reading in now). Many old blog sites had these so I thought it would fit the retro theme.</li>
            <li>Choosing the font - <a class="in-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.dafont.com/gameplay.font">"Gameplay"</a>  for the title. This gave it a sort of arcade vibe, aligning with the retro theme.</li>
            <li>Styling the table with the <b>border-collapse</b> property so you get single lines instead of double lines. This aligns with the minamalistic approach.</li>
            <li>Coming up with the "timeline" feature on the Past page. This delivered the content in a streamlined, simple and easy to read manner.</li>
            <li>Making use of the <b>scroll-behaviour</b> CSS property. Setting this to smooth makes in page nav links jump to the section specified in a smooth manner. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior" class="in-text-link" target="_blank" >Example here</a>.</li>
            <li>Using the headings, sub headings and sub-sub-headings format. This allows for the infomation to be easily absorbed and not confusing on where to find the info.</li>
            <li>For all text apart form the header and navbar, <b>Times New Roman</b> has been chosen. This is to invoke the feeling of a "raw" site, most earlier low traffic sites on the web had no font specified, and the default font for HTML was Times New Roman. Hence why I'm using it on this site now.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="accessibility" class="sub-heading">Accessibility</h3>
        <p class="text-body">When it comes to accessibility its best to let other people think of the checklist that needs to be covered as you might miss or forget something on your own. To do this I used the <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/" target="_blank">W3C Accessibility Principles</a>.</p>
        <p class="timeline-heading">Screen Readers and Internal Structure</p>
        <p class="text-body">Due to screen readers not being able to read and view media, alt text is needed for non-text content. Therefore all images have a specified alt text. This also functions as a way for audio readers to read out the whole webpage, these images can be read aloud via their alternate text. Aside from just alt text, proper HTML structure has been enforced. This includes the use of standard HTML tags such as  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>  both of which have their own default formatting. Also, table heads <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> have also been used so that the tables maintain structure as well. This means when a stylesheet cannot be used, the page still maintains a "readable" format. Below is an example of this.</p>

        <div id="screen_reader_image">
            <img src="public/images/no_stylesheet.png" alt="no stylesheet with website image">
        </div>

        <p class="timeline-heading">Mobile First Development</p>
        <p class="text-body">This site was designed with the <a class="in-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://anglestudios.co.uk/blog/why-mobile-first-web-design-is-becoming-more-important/">Mobile-First Approach</a>. The mobile first approach is useful in the fact developing screens for mobile is harder. Therefore, if done first it can make the rest of development easier. One of the more noticeable
            aspects of the mobile design is the single image per div of the site. This means you will never find two images side by side, one of the reasons is because of ease of development - a flexbox can just be used instead of multiple media queries (one for each major screen size). This also means that as you shrink the page horizontally (try it now) all the images change size slowly (due to their width properties being set using relative 'view height') and still remain centered. Due to the mobile first approach taken with the site, it actually reads better on mobile than on desktop in my opinion. Thats not saying it reads bad on desktop, just it reads even better on mobile. Below is a screenshot of what my site looks like on mobile. Awesome, isn't it?
        </p>
        <div id="mobile_image">
            <img src="public/images/mobile.png" alt="screenshot of the website viewd on mobile">
        </div>

        <p class="timeline-heading">Fonts</p>
        <p class="text-body">Across the site, all fonts have been kept to the web standard size - this can be specified with a percentage. In doing so all text scales up or down accordingly when the zoom function is used on your browser. Zooming can be performed using <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd>  and  <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> to zoom in and out respectively. This is great for users with poorer vision that need the text size just that tad bit bigger. On top of this, proper spacing has been put in place so text is not too close to the edges of the screen, as well as spacing between one another. Finally, styling tags have been used such as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for bolding text and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for italicizing them. This is good because if the stylesheet can't be accessed then some styling can still be applied - this is specifically for screen readers. </p>
    
        
        <p class="timeline-heading">Colour Blindness and Colour Contrast</p>
        <p class="text-body">As well as aethetic purposes, the colours of the website have been chosen to meet colour contrast standards properly. The use of bright text on a dark background has more contrast than the vice versa. This is because your eyes absorb light, black is the absence of light, so when you are reading black text on a white background you are looking at the absence of light. 
            Therefore, I chose the aforementioned bright text on dark. Aside from just basic readability purposes, these colour choices actually contribute to whether the site is viewable for colour blind users. There are three main types of colour blindness, absence of red cones, absence of blue cones, and absence of green cones. These are the cones in your eyes that detect a certain type of light. To test for these three different colour blind types, you can turn your site "grayscale", this takes mostly all colour out so you can just see the contrast. For this I used the <a target="_blank" class="in-text-link" href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/">Color Blind Web Page Filter</a> Below is a side by side comparison.  </p>
    
        <div id="colourblind_image">
            <img src="public/images/colour_blind_check.png" alt="side by side comparison normal vs grayscale">
        </div>
        
        <p class="text-body">As you can see the grayscaled site on the right is still quite readable. This means the contrast is high enough that even the most colour blind of people can still be able to use and read the website (albiet not to its maximum potential).</p>
        <p class="timeline-heading">Usability</p>
        <p class="text-body">Finally, usability was considered carefully throughout the whole development proccess. One of the main features is when hovering over "clickable" elements the colour changes. This includes all anchor tags, as well as the navbar. In doing so this creates a more intuitive user experience. Also, another feature is that with external links, when clicked open a new page. This is a great usuability feature as the reader can go and check out the other page, and then close it and come back to the page they were just on. This also means that they are still scrolled down to where they were up to reading, as opposed to using the back feature.  </p>
