        <p class="text-body">Yeah, so this is the super serious page where I talk about the technical aspects of this site and what not. For the theme, I was going for a retro laid-back sort of site. The colours, styling and language used represents that.</p>
        <h2 class="main-heading">Comments </h2>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Technical Aspects</h3>
        
        <p class="text-body">Below is the directory structure for my site. It consists of a public folder - containing all non .css or .html resources, e.g. images and fonts. After the public folder there is the 4 HTML files, each with their own respective content. Then you have websystems.css which contains the CSS for the entire site, this means all the styling across the site uses the same style sheet. This is great for both developmental purposes (everything is changed at once) and also design purposes (consistency).</p>

        Now that the file structure has been layed out. Its time to talk a bit about the page structure itself. Below is a table of all my main CSS classes and ids and styles
